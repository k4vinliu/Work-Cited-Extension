# Work-Cited-Extension
Instantly generate and copy citations for the current webpage with one click. Simple, fast, and accurate.

Another extension I created using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, chrome.tabs api, and more.

Functionality:
1. One-Click Citation: Cite current web page being viewed. The generated citation is immediately available for copying.
2. Metadata Retrieval: Pulls key metadata such as author's name, publication date, and publisher information from the webpage. Works with videos too.
3. Support for Different Web Page Types: Adapts to different types of web content (articles, blogs, books, videos, etc.).
